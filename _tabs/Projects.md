- Skills Demonstrated: Virtualization (VMware/VirtualBox likely), log management (Q-Radar), SIEM integration, ticketing system integration (Hive).

## Security Infrastructure with Threat Intelligence
- Description: Deployed and configured Cortex (threat intelligence platform) on Ubuntu server and MISP (another threat intelligence platform) on a Docker container. This established a foundation for threat analysis and sharing.
